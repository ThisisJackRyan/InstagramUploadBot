# InstagramUploadBot
This Program is written in python and uploads picture to instagram. As of now my only site to upload is instagram But I want to expand Youtube and Tiktok for uploading videos. My Instagram Bot uses the selenium 4.7.2 to navigate the login and upload process.

The majority of my Code is in login and mainPage using Tkinter. I have created a basic Login system and UI to manage several Instagram accounts.
This is what the mainPage UI looks like

Clicking Post button in the corner will run the Instagram Bot script and upload until all the images in a deticated folder have been posted. 


### Future Plans
  My plan with this is to add more sites to post on. I also want to incorporate machine learning so that a webscrapper will take an image and decide if it is visually pleasing enough to post. I have started this process with the Repository github.com/ThisisJackRyan/WebScrapper4DataSets. That has a working web scrapper and a script to turn the images pixels into RGBA values or create a data sets.
