# InstagramUploadBot
This Program is written in python and uploads picture to instagram. As of now my only site to upload is instagram But I want to expand Youtube and Tiktok for uploading videos. My Instagram Bot uses the selenium 4.7.2 to navigate the login and upload process.

The majority of my Code is in login and mainPage using Tkinter I have created a basic Login system and UI to manage several Instagram accounts.
This is what the mainPage UI looks like
